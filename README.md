# Machine Learning Algorthims
Codes for a few popular ML algorithms from scratch.

Inspiration from the popular <a href="https://github.com/pavleenkaur/Machine-Learning-Algorthims"/>Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng</a>

The online course encourages students to try the various algorithms in Matlab/Octave, but in this repository you can find the same done in Python instead.
